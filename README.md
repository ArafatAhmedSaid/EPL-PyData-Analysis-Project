# EPL-PyData-Analysis-Project

## 1.	Project Title:
EPL Match Performance Analysis Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib).

## 2.	Problem Statement:
This project investigates what truly drives season-long success in the EPL. By integrating the Match-Level Data and Player-Level Data, I tried to uncover deeper performance intelligence patterns.

## 3.	Project Overview
This project investigates the key drivers of success in the English Premier League (EPL) 2021/2022 season using two datasets:
•	Match-level data (Results, Goals, Shots etc.)
•	Player-level statistics (Goals, Assists, xG, xA, Min Played etc.)
This analysis was conducted using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib).

## 4.	Tools & Technologies Used:
•	Pandas – 			Python Module
•	NumPy –			Python Module
•	Matplotlib – 		Python Module
•	CSV Dataset – 		EPL Match Data (2021–2022).
